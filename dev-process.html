        <p>Wyldhaven is a music producer based out of Madison, Wisconsin. The concept for the Wyldhaven website was to be a striking announcement for his debut album and to give him a brand that he can use in the future. The goals were to quickly direct users to where they can hear the album and also to increase visibility for his social media accounts. To acheive these things, I needed the site and the brand to mentally stick with users. This was the biggest challenge for me, because I needed visuals that wouldn't easily be forgotten but that also suited the artist and the music.</p>

        <h2>Great Lakes <br />50th Anniversary Timeline</h2>
        <p>Over the course of designing this site, I went through a few iterations before I decided that a photography-based design would be the best route towards building an unforgettable brand. While I loved the idea of a single-page scrolling experience to keep the user engaged, I just felt that it needed something more. I encourged and assisted with the new photo for the website which I feel not only gave me the inspiration to complete my design, but truly built a brand for the artist. Not only is the imagery memorable, but it creates a 'character' for the artist as well. Also, the photograph itself is moody and intriguing which I felt to be a good match. I believe that the single-page scrolling setup is very engaging and keeps users on the site for a little bit longer, which helps reinforce the branding even more.</p>
